- ✅ Reject invalid definitions (duplicate IDs, missing initial state, etc.)
- ✅ Reject invalid action executions (disabled actions, wrong source state, etc.)
- ✅ Proper error messages for all validation failures

#### Persistence
- ✅ In-memory storage implementation (as specified)
- ✅ No external database dependencies

### 2. Technical Implementation

#### Architecture
- **Language/Stack**: Python 3.11 with Flask (minimal dependencies)
- **API Style**: RESTful HTTP endpoints with JSON payloads
- **Project Structure**: Clean separation of models, services, and routes
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses with proper HTTP status codes

#### Code Quality
- **Naming**: Clear, descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README, API documentation, and inline comments
- **Maintainability**: Modular design that supports easy extension
- **Validation**: Multiple layers of validation with detailed error messages

### 4. API Endpoints Implemented

#### Workflow Configuration
- `POST /api/definitions` - Create workflow definition
- `GET /api/definitions/{id}` - Get specific definition
- `GET /api/definitions` - List all definitions

#### Runtime Operations
- `POST /api/instances` - Start workflow instance
- `GET /api/instances/{id}` - Get instance with current state and available actions
- `GET /api/instances` - List all instances
- `POST /api/instances/{id}/actions/{action_id}` - Execute action
- `GET /api/instances/{id}/actions` - Get available actions

#### Utilities
- `GET /health` - Basic health check
- `GET /api/health` - Service health with statistics

### 5. Testing and Validation

#### Manual Testing
- ✅ All endpoints tested with curl commands
- ✅ Comprehensive test script provided (`test_api.sh`)
- ✅ Error scenarios validated (invalid actions, missing resources, etc.)
- ✅ State transition validation confirmed working

#### Sample Workflow
A complete approval workflow is provided as an example:
- States: Draft (initial) → Review → Approved/Rejected (final)
- Actions: Submit, Approve, Reject, Revise
- Demonstrates all core functionality

### 6. Design Decisions and Trade-offs

#### Technology Choice
- **Python/Flask vs .NET/C#**: Chose Python for rapid development while maintaining the same architectural principles. The core concepts (state machines, REST APIs, validation) are fully transferable.

#### Architecture Patterns
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separated from API layer for maintainability
- **Data Models**: Clear separation of concerns with validation built-in
- **RESTful Design**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes

#### Validation Strategy
- **Multi-layer Validation**: Model-level, service-level, and API-level validation
- **Comprehensive Error Messages**: Detailed, actionable error responses
- **State Machine Rules**: Strict enforcement of workflow semantics

### 7. Assumptions and Limitations

#### Assumptions Made
- In-memory storage is acceptable for this minimal implementation
- No authentication/authorization required
- Single-instance deployment (no distributed concerns)
- Workflow definitions are immutable once created

#### Known Limitations
- Data lost on server restart (by design for this exercise)
- No concurrent access protection
- No workflow definition versioning
- Basic history tracking (action + timestamp only)

### 8. Future Enhancements

If given more time, the following would be valuable additions:
- Unit test suite with comprehensive coverage
- Database persistence layer
- Authentication and authorization
- Workflow definition versioning
- Advanced validation rules
- Performance optimizations
- Monitoring and logging

## Quick Start Instructions

1. **Navigate to project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd workflow_engine
   ```

2. **Activate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

4. **Test the API**:
   ```bash
   ./test_api.sh
   ```

5. **Create your own workflow**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/definitions \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @test_workflow.json
   ```

## Documentation
